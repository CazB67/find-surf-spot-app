# Find Surf Spot
Project 1

## Description

Forecast Websites are difficult to interpret and read. It is difficult to know where the best place to surf will be based on the conditions and a person's surfing ability. Thus a web application that uses Willy Weather API to recommend best surf sports in the Perth metropolitan area has been developed.

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using the **Find Surf Spot** application to refer me to a beach location
WHEN I first arrive at the webpage, I select my level of ability.
THEN I can provide my geolocation, or select sites near my current location.
WHEN I choose when I want to surf: 6-9am, 11-2pm or 3-6pm.
THEN I am shown a list of suitable surf spots based on their proximity to me.
WHEN I click on a surf spot in the list
THEN I am presented with the following information about that spot:

- Location and map of the surfspot 
- Coastal weather warnings (if any)
